We're over two weeks into this whole blogging debacle, I guess it's time to start actually spellchecking my blog posts. I'm adapting this from [[http://blog.binchen.org/posts/what-s-the-best-spell-check-set-up-in-emacs.html][What's the best spell check setup in emacs]], which was updated within the last month. Looking into Hunspell versus Aspell, it turns out that the latter is unmaintained while the former had a release in the last month.

The first thing I need to ensure is that both American and Canadian spellings work, because I have to write in both styles, constantly.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 ðŸ‘» echo color colour | hunspell -a -d en_CA,en_US
 @(#) International Ispell Version 3.2.06 (but really Hunspell 1.3.3)
 *
 *
#+END_EXAMPLE

Seems like Hunspell does what I need.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq ispell-program-name "hunspell"
        ispell-local-dictionary "en_CA"
        ispell-local-dictionary-alist
        '(("en_CA" "[[:alpha:]]" "[^[:alpha:]]" "[']" nil ("-d" "en_CA,en_US") nil utf-8)))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'flyspell-mode)
  (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'flyspell-prog-mode)
#+END_SRC
