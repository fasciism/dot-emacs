The blinking cursor is in some ways a useful feedback mechanism: it draws your attention to it and indicates that the terminal hasn't stalled. Personally, I don't want it drawing my attention, since attention is a precious, limited, and fleeting resource. I also use the GUI almost exclusively, so terminal stalls aren't as frequent.

#+END_SRC
