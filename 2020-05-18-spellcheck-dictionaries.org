#+title: Spellcheck Dictionaries

I first tackled spellchecking [[https://fasciism.com/2017/01/16/spellchecking/][way back]] at the start of this blog, but I only configured the files and languages, not the dictionaries and environment. Three work laptops later, this has become a problem. First I'll install Hunspell on the MacBook:

#+begin_example
  % brew install hunspell
  ...
  ==> Caveats
  Dictionary files (*.aff and *.dic) should be placed in
  ~/Library/Spelling/ or /Library/Spelling/.
#+end_example

Then I'll fetch the [[https://extensions.libreoffice.org/extensions/english-dictionaries][dictionaries]] and extract them where I want them to go, non-standard as that may be:

#+begin_example
  % mkdir ~/.hunspell

  % file dict-en-20200501.oxt
  dict-en-20200501.oxt: Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract

  % unzip dict-en-20200501.oxt
  Archive:  dict-en-20200501.oxt
    ...
    inflating: en_CA.aff
    inflating: en_CA.dic
    inflating: en_US.aff
    inflating: en_US.dic
    ...
#+end_example

Having to worry about different shells (Bash, Zsh, Eshell) using different startup files for setting environment variables annoyed me, so I decided I'm going to have a =~/.environment= file that I make my shells all read from. While I could have used =~/.profile= and then told Zsh to read from it, I'd rather a file no tool is going to get clever with and mangle.

#+begin_example
  % cat ~/.environment
  # Required by Hunspell
  export DICPATH="$HOME/.hunspell"

  % cat ~/.profile
  source ~/.environment

  % cat ~/.zshenv
  source ~/.environment
#+end_example

Deleting all but those four files, since those are the languages (dialects) in which I write, I make then need to test that they're active. First I ensure I have a fresh session and then:

#+begin_example
% hunspell -D
SEARCH PATH:
.::/Users/mak/.hunspell:...

AVAILABLE DICTIONARIES (path is not mandatory for -d option):
/Users/mak/.hunspell/en_CA
/Users/mak/.hunspell/en_US
#+end_example

Next, I [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food][dogfood]] Hunspell by running it on its own README, and after ignoring the many false-positives I found an actual mistake:

[[https://fasciism.com/img/2020-05-19-spelling.png]]

Hunspell was still screaming about not being able to find dictionaries, so I need to be pulling things out of shell environment variables properly. There's a package for exactly that:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package exec-path-from-shell
    :pin melpa
    :config
    (add-to-list 'exec-path-from-shell-variables "DICPATH")
    (exec-path-from-shell-initialize))
#+end_src

And now I'm save from spelling mistakes once again.
