To celebrate one full month of blogging, I have written a function that will post the HTML and Org files that comprise each day's blog entry automatically with Midnight, as seen earlier this month.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun mak::fasciism-post-daily-blog ()
    "Posts daily blog in HTML and Org format to respective GitHub repos."
    ;; Publish the project to ensure the HTML file is on disk.
    (org-publish-project "fasciism")
    ;; Set up the common one-liner to publish a file.
    (let ((cmd (string-join
                '("cd %s"
                  "git add %s-*.%s"
                  "git commit -m 'Daily blog post.'"
                  "git push")
                " && "))
          (date (format-time-string "%F")))
      ;; Publish the HTML file.
      (let ((file (format "_posts/%s" date)))
        (shell-command (format cmd "~/src/fasciism" file "html") "*fasciism-blog-post::html*"))
      ;; Publish the Org file.
      (shell-command (format cmd "~/.emacs.d" date "org") "*fasciism-blog-post::org*")))

  (add-hook 'midnight-mode 'mak::fasciism-post-daily-blog)
#+END_SRC

And with that, we've made it! An entire month sticking to the built-in features of Emacs and using it every day. Tomorrow I will lift that self-imposed restriction and dive into the wide world of packages.
