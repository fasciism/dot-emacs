For all of the minor modes that I use, I enable them globally. This may change in the future, as can anything, but for now I have no need to know which minor modes are enabled, because the answer is "All the ones I like." Diminish is a package that allows the replacement or omission of mode names in the mode line.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package diminish
    :ensure t
    :pin melpa-stable
    :config
    (progn
     ;; Diminish built-in modes we've already enabled.
     (diminish 'flyspell-mode)
     (diminish 'visual-line-mode)
     (diminish 'whitespace-mode)))
#+END_SRC

Since we have not yet installed any new minor modes, we will diminish only those which are part of the base system. In future entries we will use =:diminish= in =use-package= to include packages in the list that Diminish affects.
