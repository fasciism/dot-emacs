Since clearing my configuration, my filesystem has started to drown in =*~= files and the occasional =#*#= file. This is a result of Emacs's default safety net, which I do not appreciate.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq auto-save-default nil  ; Prevent *~  files
        make-backup-files nil) ; Prevent #*# files
#+END_SRC

I'm sure I'll live to regret this. You'll notice that I used the more compact form of setting multiple variables this time. I'm going to stick with that from now on.
