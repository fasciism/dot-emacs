I stopped doing development for a living three years ago, having moved into security consulting and penetration testing since. Now that I'm setting up Emacs again, I can't believe how much I have missed [[https://magit.vc/][Magit]]. While Org-mode and Gnus are the main killer apps for Emacs, they are sprawling. Magit is extremely fast, tight, focused, and beautiful. As mentioned [[http://fasciism.com/2017/02/09/cue-ball/][yesterday]], I have been doing some open source development recently, and one thing I believe in when making contributions to the code of others is tight diffs. Magit makes it so that the use of a =git add -p= equivalent is very accessible.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package magit
    :ensure t
    :pin melpa
    :bind
    ("C-c C-g" . magit-status))
    :config
    (setq magit-diff-refine-hunk 'all)
#+END_SRC

Magit's maintainer is very active, new releases are frequent. I love Magit so much that I contribute to the [[https://www.patreon.com/tarsius][maintainer's Patreon]]. It's really that good.
