One thing I've always liked about the Windows Add/Remove Programs interface is that it provides you a date that the installed program was last used. When paring down the number of programs on a Windows computer, that date is helpful to gauge whether a program is useful enough to keep around. Since the number of Emacs packages tends to sprawl over time, I have installed the Keyfreq package to track the commands I use:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package keyfreq
    :ensure t
    :pin melpa-stable
    :init
    (setq keyfreq-dir (expand-file-name "keyfreq" state-emacs-directory)
          keyfreq-file (expand-file-name "statistics" keyfreq-dir) 
          keyfreq-file-lock (expand-file-name "lockfile" keyfreq-dir))
    (make-directory keyfreq-dir t)
    :config
    (keyfreq-mode 1)
    (keyfreq-autosave-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: t

When I first installed this package, I didn't honestly think it would be that useful. But since installing it, I have used its output to appreciate how much my usage of certain commands is changing.
