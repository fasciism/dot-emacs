I needed to sort through a lot of email recently. This got really annoying in a hurry. I use a pseudo-GTD system where I have several folders that are ordered with numbers in their names, so I decided to bind the number keys so that pressing them moves either the currently-selected article or all marked articles to the associated group.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :exports none
  ;;; -*- lexical-binding: t -*-
#+END_SRC

The first thing I had to do was declare that this file, when converted to =.el= format, would use lexical binding. The reason for this is that the lambdas we create need to have of their =group= variable bound.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :exports none
  (dolist (name '("0-capture"
                  "1-deferred"
                  "2-waiting-for"
                  "7-tickler"
                  "8-someday-maybe"
                  "9-archive"))
    (let ((group (format "nnimap+kolybabi:%s" name))
          (number (substring name 0 1)))
      (define-key gnus-summary-mode-map number
        (lambda () (interactive)
          (gnus-summary-move-article nil group nil)))))
#+END_SRC
