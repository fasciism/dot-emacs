No, I couldn't just call this post "Helm". The terrible title I chose called to me, and so I acquiesced. Helm is the most invasive package I've installed thus far. It replaces the majority of commands where user input is expected (e.g., =C-x b=, =C-x C-f=, =C-x k=, =M-x=) with its own version. Helms commands offer lists of candidates, shown in a pop-up window, which can be filtered, navigated, and selected. This is far more powerful than the default commands, and I find it useful.

An instance of =C-x C-f= (=helm-find-files=) appears as follows:

Now let's get that package in the system.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package helm
    :ensure t
    :pin melpa-stable
    :diminish helm-mode
    :bind
    ("M-x" . helm-M-x)
    ("C-x C-f" . helm-find-files)
    :init
    (setq helm-mode-fuzzy-match t)
    :config
    (helm-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

Fuzzy matching has been enabled, which requires more processing of a list of candidates, but I have used this feature in the past and appreciated it. To explain be example, I can type =C-h v hmfm= looking for =helm-mode-fuzzy-match= and the list of candidates will include every variable that matches the regex =.*h.*m.*f.*m.*=, which is a lot of candidates. As always, if this annoys me later I can disable it effortlessly.

When I initially installed Helm, I limited its use to =M-x=, but found that I enjoyed it a great deal. I have used Interactive Do (Ido) in earlier times, but I like Helm better. There's also Ivy which is the new kid on the block, but until Helm pisses me off someday it has my (fickle) loyalty.
