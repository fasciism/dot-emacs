Even though I rarely close Emacs, when it starts up a splash buffer named =GNU Emacs= is displayed:

[[http://fasciism.com/img/2017-01-06-gnu-emacs-buffer.png]]

This is unnecessary for me, so I'll disable it:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq inhibit-startup-screen t
        inhibit-startup-message t)
#+END_SRC

In addition to the splash screen, I feel no need to be told what the =*scratch*= buffer is for with it saying this each time:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ;; This buffer is for text that is not saved, and for Lisp evaluation.
  ;; To create a file, visit it with C-x C-f and enter text in its buffer.
#+END_EXAMPLE

We can force the =*scratch*= buffer to start blank with:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq initial-scratch-message nil)
#+END_SRC
