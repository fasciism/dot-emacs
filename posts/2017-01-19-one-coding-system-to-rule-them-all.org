Since the year 2010, I've felt like I live in the future. Strangely, 2000 and 2001 didn't have quite the same effect. Regardless, we do live in the future so it's time to accept that ASCII has been superseded. This originally came from [[https://thraxys.wordpress.com/2016/01/13/utf-8-in-emacs-everywhere-forever/][this blog post.]]

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq locale-coding-system 'utf-8)
  (set-terminal-coding-system 'utf-8)
  (set-keyboard-coding-system 'utf-8)
  (set-selection-coding-system 'utf-8)
  (prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)
  (when (display-graphic-p)
    (setq x-select-request-type '(UTF8_STRING COMPOUND_TEXT TEXT STRING)))
#+END_SRC

With that done, it's time to use =C-x 8 RET 0950= to test our settings with a Unicode code point that looks similar to the Emacs logo: [[http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0950/index.htm][‡•ê]].
