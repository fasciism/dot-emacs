I've been diving into a lot of files that are poorly-organized recently, and I came across Origami-Mode, which seems like it would really help me get my bearings.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package origami
    :ensure t
    :pin melpa
    :bind
    ("C-F" . origami-recursively-toggle-node)
    ("C-c f o" . origami-open-all-nodes)
    ("C-c f c" . origami-close-all-nodes)
    ("C-c f ." . origami-show-only-node))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun mak::folding ()
    (interactive)
    (save-place-mode 1)
    (origami-mode 1)
    ;; The line below must be called after savehist runs
    (call-interactively 'origami-show-only-node))
#+END_SRC
