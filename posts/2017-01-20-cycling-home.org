I have noticed the configurations of many others use a function similar to the one below to add some intelligence to moving to the start of a line. It seems like a good idea.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun mak::cycle-bol-boi ()
    "Cycle between beginning of line and beginning of indentation."
    (interactive)
    (let ((orig (point)))
      (back-to-indentation)
      (when (= orig (point))
        (move-beginning-of-line 1))))

  (global-set-key (kbd "C-a") 'mak::cycle-bol-boi)
  (global-set-key (kbd "<home>") 'mak::cycle-bol-boi)
#+END_SRC
