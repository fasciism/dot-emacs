Emacs has an excellent undo system, once you get the hang of it. But as with all things Emacs, it could be better!

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package undo-tree
    :ensure t
    :pin elpa
    :diminish undo-tree-mode
    :bind
    ("C-z" . undo)
    ("M-z" . undo-tree-redo)
    ("C-M-z" . undo-tree-visualize)
    :config
    (global-undo-tree-mode)
    (setq undo-tree-visualizer-diff t))
#+END_SRC

Let's see how the undo tree looks for this buffer:

As you can see, I've performed several undo and redo operations at this point, and can navigate through them. If I choose any node in the undo tree, I will be presented with an explanatory diff telling me what that node's change represents in a small window.
