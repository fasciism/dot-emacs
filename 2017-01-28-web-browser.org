Just a minor configuration change today. I've noticed that when I trigger URLs in Emacs in various modes my web browser doesn't pop up properly. I've looked at a few options for fixing this, and the most straightforward one is this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq browse-url-browser-function 'browse-url-generic
        browse-url-generic-program "firefox")
#+END_SRC

That is all. Good day to you.
