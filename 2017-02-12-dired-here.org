One thing that occurs frequently in my Emacs usage is opening a Dired buffer based on the current context of the file I am in. For example, when editing this file I would like =C-x d= to a Dired buffer representing =~/.emacs.d=, and ensure that the buffer represents the current state of the filesystem. The default is for =C-x d= to require confirmation of the location, and to not refresh the Dired buffer if it already exists.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun mak::dired-here ()
    "Make an up-to-date Dired buffer for the current location."
    (interactive)
    (dired ".")
    (revert-buffer))

  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x d") 'mak::dired-here)
#+END_SRC

While this is a minor change, it is satisfying.
