One nice feature I've experienced in some Vim installations is the editor remembering where my cursor was the last time I viewed a file. Emacs can do that, too:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq save-place-file "~/.emacs.d/saved-point-places"
        save-place-forget-unreadable-files nil)
  (save-place-mode t)
#+END_SRC
