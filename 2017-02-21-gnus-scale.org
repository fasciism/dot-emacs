One thing that started bugging me immediately upon using Gnus was the prompt for how many messages I wanted to load from my inbox when it had more than 200 messages in it. It turns out that this behaviour is controlled by =gnus-large-newsgroup=, described as:

#+BEGIN_VERSE
The number of articles which indicates a large newsgroup.

If the number of articles in a newsgroup is greater than this value, confirmation is required for selecting the newsgroup.

If it is nil, no confirmation is required.
#+END_VERSE

So let's stop this right now:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq gnus-large-newsgroup nil)
#+END_SRC

Now I feel less like Gnus is judging me for the size of my inbox.
