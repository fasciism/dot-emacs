Emacs keybindings are not simple. But they are discoverable and memorable, once you get past the initial shock at least. The Guide-Key package helps with that by popping up a new window displaying a list of keys available at the current moment.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package guide-key
    :ensure t
    :pin melpa-stable
    :diminish guide-key-mode
    :init
    (setq guide-key/guide-key-sequence
          '("C-c" "C-x r" "C-x 4" "C-x 5" "C-x 8"))
    :config
    (guide-key-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

For instance, while writing this blog I can press =C-x r= and receive a list of possibilities shown below:

You'll notice that we used the =:diminish= option above, with the name of the minor mode as its value. That indicates that Diminish should omit the minor mode from the mode line entirely. Alternatively, I could have offered an abbreviation such as =GK=.
