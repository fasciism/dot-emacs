I've wanted to try Company-Mode for a while, so I enabled it today. It's one of the rare packages available in ELPA as opposed to MELPA. Company is a completion framework that offers a popup list after a delay (or immediately when called) in the current buffer.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package company
    :ensure t
    :pin elpa
    :config
    (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'global-company-mode))
#+END_SRC

That's all the configuration it needs to start. From this point on I'll have popups whenever there are several options for a prefix that I've typed, or a dim suffix inline.
