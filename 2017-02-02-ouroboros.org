As you might have guessed, writing my Emacs configuration in this style leads me to need to reload the system often to ensure that things are in the correct order as I make new drafts and go back to fix mistakes. So far I have been handling this by manually calling =M-x kill-emacs= and running the program anew. Now that we have packages available, [[https://github.com/iqbalansari/restart-emacs][restart-emacs]] gives us a better way:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun mak::restart-emacs-or-release-file ()
    (interactive)
    (if server-buffer-clients
        (server-edit)
      (when (y-or-n-p "Restart Emacs? ")
        (restart-emacs '("--debug-init")))))

  (use-package restart-emacs
    :ensure t
    :pin melpa-stable
    :bind ("C-x C-c" . mak::restart-emacs-or-release-file))
#+END_SRC

On [[http://fasciism.com/2017/01/03/simplified-confirmations/][Day 3]] we changed confirmations to =y-or-n-p=, and on [[http://fasciism.com/2017/01/04/no-escape/][Day 4]] we removed the keybinding that exited Emacs. Now we change our setup to ensure that if we hit =C-x C-c= Emacs will restart itself, unless it is within a buffer (and frame for my configuration) created by emacsclient, in which case it will return from emacsclient.
